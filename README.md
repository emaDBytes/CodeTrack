# CodeTrack
CodeTrack is a web application that helps BIT (or IT) students track their daily coding time.


I propose to develop CodeTrack, a web application designed to help BIT (Business Information Technology) students track their daily coding time. This project will allow me to apply the Java and Spring skills I've learned throughout the course while creating a valuable tool for my fellow students.
Project Overview: CodeTrack will be a simple yet effective platform for BIT students to log and monitor their coding activities. The main goal is to help students build consistent coding habits and gain insights into their time investment in programming.
Core Features:
1.      User Management: 
o    Student registration (sign up)
o    Authentication (sign in)
o    Password reset functionality
2.      Time Tracking: 
    Log daily coding sessions with start time, end time, and associated project or course
o    View personal coding history
    Edit or delete logged sessions
3.      Dashboard: 
    Display summaries of daily, weekly, and monthly coding time
    Show coding streaks (consecutive days of coding)
Technical Implementation Plan:
1.      Backend: Java with Spring Boot
2.      Database: Initially H2 for development, with plans to migrate to PostgreSQL for production
3.      Frontend: Thymeleaf for server-side rendering with basic Bootstrap for styling
4.      Security: Implement Spring Security for user authentication
5.      Testing: Develop unit tests, integration tests, and API tests
6.      Version Control: Host the project on GitHub
Additional Features (time permitting):
·         Personal coding time goal setting
·         Simple notifications for goal achievements
·         Tagging system for different programming languages or technologies used
·         Basic data visualization for coding trends
This project aligns well with the course requirements and grading criteria. It demonstrates database connectivity, authentication, and provides ample opportunities for testing. By hosting on GitHub and potentially deploying to a cloud platform, I aim to meet the criteria for higher grades.
As I develop the project, I plan to explore additional Spring Boot functionalities not covered in lectures, such as implementing a simple RESTful API for future mobile app integration or incorporating OAuth2 with GitHub for social login.
Through this project, I hope to create a practical tool that not only showcases the skills I've learned in the Back End Programming course but also provides value to the BIT student community by encouraging consistent coding practice.
